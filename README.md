# Mask Detection

My Team and I developed a Distributed Deep Learning pipeline to build a face mask detection system.
We loaded the image files from S3, pre-processed data using PySpark, and stored it in a MongoDB Atlas database.
We then used distributed PyTorch to train a face mask detection system by transfer learning using different architectures, to reduce computaional time.
